This project contains a notebook used to complete homework 5 in CS 498, _Applied Machine Learning_.  It was completed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Spring, 2019 by Brian Hicks and Joe Everton.

Joe presented the concepts and findings behind this homework to the Hillsboro Python Machine Learning Meetup on [May 21, 2019](https://www.meetup.com/Hillsboro-Python-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/261301275/).  The slides he used are available at that link, and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACzvJjNRUfNwfaHEgcP_Asd9L76hJf_3/view).

The focus of the homework is on implementing Vector Quantization, a technique described in section 9.3.1 of the course text, [Applied Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-18114-7) by David Forsyth.
